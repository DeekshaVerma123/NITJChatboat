        "<h3>Importance of Internships for Placements at NIT Jalandhar</h3><p>While internships are not officially mandatory for placements at NIT Jalandhar, they are highly recommended and play a significant role in enhancing a student’s profile. Here’s why internships are important:</p><ul><li><strong>Practical Experience:</strong> Internships provide hands-on industry exposure, which is valued by recruiters during placement interviews.</li><li><strong>Resume Boost:</strong> Having internship experience makes your resume stand out and demonstrates initiative and real-world problem-solving skills.</li><li><strong>Skill Development:</strong> Internships help students apply theoretical knowledge in practical settings, improving both technical and soft skills.</li><li><strong>PPO Opportunities:</strong> Many companies offer Pre-Placement Offers (PPOs) to interns who perform well, allowing students to secure job offers before the placement season begins.</li><li><strong>Interview Preparation:</strong> Internship experience often becomes a topic of discussion during technical and HR interviews, giving students more to talk about with confidence.</li></ul><p>Although it is possible to get placed without an internship, students with relevant experience tend to have a competitive edge. Hence, most students at NIT Jalandhar pursue internships, especially during the summer break after their pre-final year.</p>"
